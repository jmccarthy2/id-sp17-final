  <h1><i>*the gossip</i><h1>
  <h3 class="max-width">Donald Trump has singlehandedly weaponized Twitter as the 45th president of the United States. Anything he says in 140 characters can affect millions of people, spreading his unfair and factually incorrect statements across the world wide web . He has taken little to no  worry in making himself seem professional, using his newly given power for his own personal gains. Some impressionable children may see this activity and learn it to be right, acting upon the “role model” they see online and choosing to be the same way in their own lives.
